## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This porject has been an eye opener for mea because i've learnt a lot from completing this challenge

Some of the things learnt during this challenge includes, but not limited to:

- Better way to use css costume properties
- How to better use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) for semantic
- A better understanding of css Queries
- How to use the @support to make browsers that support a particular css rule apply it, this way, you end up not breaking things. For example

```css
@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(2rem)) {
  .primary-navigation {
    background-color: rgba(11, 11, 22, 0.152);
    backdrop-filter: blur(2rem);
  }
}
```

- The use of costum properties

### Continued development

In the future, i want continued developmentmy css javascript and more on semantic html. Challenges like this will go a long way
